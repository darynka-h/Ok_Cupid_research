# Ok_Cupid_research
*Goal of the Project*

The goal of this project is to analyze the OkCupid Proles dataset to explore tendencies and
relationships in user behavior on the dating app. Specically, we aim to test four hypotheses
about tness, income and age variation among users. These insights will help understand
people in dating apps what to expect from people with dierent characteristics.

- H1: The average level of tness is higher for vegetarians than nonvegetarians.
3. Incomes of men and women are the same:
- H0: The average income of male and female users is the same.
- H1: The average income of males is greater than the mean income of females.
